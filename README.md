# SQl_Pizza_Sales_Analysis

I recently completed a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data to provide actionable insights for a fictional pizza restaurant. The goal of this project was to optimize the restaurant's operations, understand customer preferences, and maximize revenue through data-driven strategies. This project allowed me to leverage my skills in data analysis, visualization, and SQL querying.

Project Overview
The project involved analyzing four key datasets:

Order Details – Information on individual items ordered in each transaction.
Orders – Records of each order placed by customers, including date and time.
Pizza Types – Descriptions and classifications of the different types of pizzas offered.
Pizzas – Detailed information about each pizza, including size and price.
Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis were:

To gain insights into customer preferences regarding pizza sizes, types, and categories.
To identify the top-performing pizzas in terms of both orders and revenue.
To analyze sales patterns over time, including peak hours, days, and seasonal trends.
To provide recommendations for improving operational efficiency and boosting overall sales.

Key Insights & Findings
Order Patterns by Size:Large pizzas were the most popular size, with over 18,500 orders, indicating a preference for value and serving size. Meanwhile, extra-large and extra-extra-large pizzas had minimal demand, suggesting an opportunity to streamline the menu.
Top Pizza Types:The Classic Deluxe Pizza and Barbecue Chicken Pizza topped the charts with over 2400 orders each. This revealed strong customer preferences for these types of pizzas, suggesting they should be prominently featured in promotions.
Revenue-Driving Pizzas:The Thai Chicken Pizza was the highest revenue generator, contributing over $43,000, followed by the Barbecue Chicken Pizza and California Chicken Pizza. These high-performing items should remain a focus for maximizing profit.
Customer Buying Behavior:Analysis showed that Classic and Supreme pizzas were the most frequently ordered categories, each contributing a significant share to the overall sales. This trend highlighted the importance of maintaining a wide variety within these categories to cater to diverse customer tastes.
Peak Hours of Operation:Order activity peaked around Hour 3 (possibly 3 AM), suggesting a high demand for late-night pizzas. This data can be used to optimize staffing and supply chain operations during these peak times, ensuring customer satisfaction and timely service.
Revenue Growth Over Time:A notable increase in revenue between March and July indicated strong seasonal demand, possibly due to promotions or events. Sustained growth throughout the year suggested that the business maintained consistent performance even after peak periods.

Tools and Techniques Used
Advanced Excel: I used Excel for data cleaning, filtering, and analysis. Pivot tables and formulas were employed to explore patterns and summarize sales figures. I also created detailed charts to visualize order distributions and revenue trends.
SQL: I leveraged SQL queries to extract, filter, and aggregate data from the four datasets. This allowed for efficient calculation of metrics like average pizzas sold per day, revenue per pizza type, and the total number of orders placed.
Data Visualization: I created various visualizations (line charts, bar graphs) to present key trends like peak order times, category-wise distribution of pizzas, and revenue growth over time. These visuals played a crucial role in identifying patterns and making data-driven conclusions.
